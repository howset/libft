# libft
This libft project was very difficult for me, because I had left the activity for almost 2 years at this point. Being left behind in the batch that meant that I had to catch up to be on the same page with everyone else. I took a freeze for around 2 weeks during Christmas to buy time to work on the functions on my own. Ended up with a *frankenstein* library because I relied on the codes I found lying around the net and tried to adopt them to my own understanding. I tried to be as explicit as possible whenever I could get away with it and avoided using direct pointer operations. Didn't even try to go for the bonuses because the deadline was hovering really near.
